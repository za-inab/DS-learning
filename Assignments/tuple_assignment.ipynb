    "## Lesson 3.2: Tuples\n",
    "### Assignment 1: Creating and Accessing Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a tuple with the first 10 positive integers. Print the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 2: Accessing Tuple Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the first, middle, and last elements of the tuple created in Assignment 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 3: Tuple Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the first three elements, the last three elements, and the elements from index 2 to 5 of the tuple created in Assignment 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 4: Nested Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a nested tuple representing a 3x3 matrix and print the matrix. Access and print the element at the second row and third column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 5: Tuple Concatenation\n",
    "\n",
    "Concatenate two tuples: (1, 2, 3) and (4, 5, 6). Print the resulting tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 6: Tuple Methods\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Create a tuple containing 3 tuples, each with 3 elements. Print the tuple of tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 10: Tuple and List\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a tuple with the first 5 positive integers. Convert it to a list, append the number 6, and convert it back to a tuple. Print the resulting tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 11: Tuple and String\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a tuple with the characters of a string. Join the tuple elements into a single string. Print the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 12: Tuple and Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a dictionary with tuple keys and integer values. Print the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 13: Nested Tuple Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a nested tuple and iterate over the elements, printing each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 14: Tuple and Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a tuple with duplicate elements. Convert it to a set to remove duplicates and print the resulting set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 15: Tuple Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Write functions that take a tuple and return the minimum, maximum, and sum of the elements. Print the results for a sample tuple."
